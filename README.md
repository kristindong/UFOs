# UFOs

## Overview

We use JavaScript and HTML to build a website to display UFO sighting data. The website is interactive and allows the user to enter multiple search criteria, for example, by date, city, etc., which are then used to filter the data displayed in a table

## Results

Using input boxes, the user can enter a single or any combination of the following criteria:
- date
- city
- state
- country
- shape of the object

The D3 JavaScript library allows the script to listen for changes to the input boxes as the user updates the search criteria. When a change is detected, a function is called to read the new input value(s), which are then used to filter the original dataset. Finally, only data matching the search criteria are displayed in the table using HTML tags and Bootstrap styling
